Project Specification
========

Requirements:

1. Code must be:
   1. Clean. Visual appeal in the source code is a must.
   2. Efficient. This must have a small footprint.
   3. Self-documenting. It must be readable enough that it needs no comments. Function and variable names must be clear.
   4. Modular. Each function should be as small as possible, drawing on features from other functions. Building blocks.
   5. In line with the general "feel" of the rest of the project.
2. Functionality should be generally in line with the community's needs.
3. Get somebody else to look your code over before submitting a pull request.
